* 16 oct : I watched tutorials to paint a gunpla on Youtube ( in english )

* 20 oct : I read a light novel called Konosuba and it was very amazing

* 11 nov : I am reading a other light novel in english. it is called " Combatants will be dispatched !". it is very fun but the most difficult in this reading is the comprehension of jokes.

* 5 feb : I finished the volume 1 of " Combatant will be dispatched ". But now, I am reading the volume 2 of it.
