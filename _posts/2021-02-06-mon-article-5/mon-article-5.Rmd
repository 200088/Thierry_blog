# ANALYSIS ABOUT THE STUDY

* Researchers?
  + Markus Knaden ( chemical ecologist) and his colleagues 
  + from Max plank Institute for chemical Ecology


* Published in? when (if mentioned)? 
  + Journal of Chemical Ecology




* General topic
  + the changement of behavior by the tobacco hawkmoth caused by The ozone’s effect on the smell of the jasmine tobacco flower


* Procedure/what was examined 
  + 1.	To use a tube with normal smell of the flower = the moth is attracted.
  + 2.	To use a tube with a tube with a smell modified by ozone = the moth is not attracted
  + 3.	To use a tube with colors similar to the flower + sugar water + smell modified = the moth is attracted
  + 4.	To use the tube with smell modified without colors and sugar water = the moth is attracted


* Conclusions/ discovery 
  + The tobacco hawkmoth can adapt to the pollution.


* Remaining questions
  + Wich others pollinators can adapt to the pollution ?
