```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = FALSE)
```



```{r}
SciViews::R
```


```{r importation}
urchin <- read("urchin_bio", package = "data.io")
```


To begining, I am going to speak about the data used. this data are from the professor Philippe Grosjean about the devellopement of a urchin specie called Paracentrotus lividus Lamarck (1816).

```{r}
chart(urchin, diameter1 ~ origin %fill=% origin) +
  geom_boxplot()
```

We can see that the urchins from farm can reach a bigger diameter and the higest diameter can reach more than 60 mm. I choosed this graphic to show a difference between urchins to different environments.
